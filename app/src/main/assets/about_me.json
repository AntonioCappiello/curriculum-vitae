  "carrier": "I have started my career at GLI as software tester for online gambling platforms. After 5 months, I became Software Engineering at the R&D department of Sitecom, a Dutch networking company. Over there I have worked for about two years, first as C-based firmware developer for modem and router, and later on as Android developer by proposing and building what turned out to be not only my first app, but also the most important app for the company. This app, named MyWiFi, has thousands of users and a 4+ rating on the Google Play store.\n\nAfterwards I moved to the best e-commerce company of the Benelux, Coolblue, looking for new challenges. At Coolblue, I have been the first Android developer and as such I have been responsible for building the Mobile Apps Team, for implementing the very first app for the company and for laying the foundation for building future apps.",
